Novel Text scene Localization and detection
- Description:
Given an image , contianing  text find regions that the texts resides and draw boxes around them and also perform OCR with the detected regions of the text.
What is the advantage:
we do not have to process all pixel values of the input image for character detection.
Existing solution: 
Tons of existing solution--- demo from oxford project thingy
demonstrate that it is not so perfect in the regions it proposes with text

What we are going to do :
We will enforce a network with new approaches of regularization to output finer box regression proposals
Try to compare against state of the art ....!!!!!!(tan ta na naaaaaaaaaaam)
